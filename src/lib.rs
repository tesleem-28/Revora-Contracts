//
// Rationale for each group:
//   clippy::dbg_macro          â€” debug output must never reach production WASM
//   clippy::todo               â€” incomplete code paths are a security risk in a

//   clippy::unimplemented      â€” same rationale as todo
//   clippy::panic              â€” panics in no_std WASM abort the host; every
//                                failure must return a typed RevoraError instead
//   clippy::unwrap_used        â€” unwrap() in contract code hides error paths;
//                                use .ok_or(RevoraError::...) or explicit match
//   clippy::expect_used        â€” same rationale as unwrap_used
//   clippy::wildcard_imports   â€” explicit imports keep the public API surface
//                                auditable and prevent accidental re-exports
//   clippy::manual_let_else    â€” prefer let-else for early-return clarity

    //        The contract stores a `SnapshotEntry` and emits `snap_com`.
    //     2. Issuer calls `apply_snapshot_shares` (one or more times) to write
    //        holder shares for this snapshot into persistent storage.
    //        Each call appends a bounded batch of (holder, share_bps) pairs.

    //   Security assumptions:
    //   - `content_hash` is caller-supplied and stored verbatim. The contract
    //     does NOT verify it matches the on-chain holder entries. Off-chain
    //     consumers MUST recompute and compare the hash.
    //   - Snapshot refs are strictly monotonic per offering; replay is impossible.
    //   - `apply_snapshot_shares` is idempotent per (snapshot_ref, index): writing
    //     the same index twice overwrites with the same value (no double-credit).
    //   - Only the current offering issuer may commit or apply snapshots.
    //   - Frozen/paused contract blocks all snapshot writes.

    ///    the index is not advanced and the holder may retry. Soroban's atomic transaction

    ///
    /// 2. **Index advances only on processed periods**: The index is set to
    ///    `last_claimed_idx`, which reflects only periods that passed the delay check.
    ///    Periods blocked by `ClaimDelaySecs` are not counted; the function returns
    ///    `ClaimDelayNotElapsed` without writing any state.
    ///
    /// 3. **Zero-payout periods advance the index**: A period with `revenue = 0` (or
    ///    where `revenue * share_bps / 10_000 == 0` due to truncation) still advances
    ///    `LastClaimedIdx`. No transfer is issued for zero amounts. This prevents
    ///    permanently stuck indices on dust periods.
    ///
    /// 4. **Exhausted state returns `NoPendingClaims`**: Once `LastClaimedIdx >= PeriodCount`,
    ///    every subsequent call returns `Err(NoPendingClaims)` without touching storage.
    ///    Callers may safely retry without risk of side effects.
    ///
    /// 5. **Per-holder isolation**: Each holder's `LastClaimedIdx` is keyed by
    ///    `(offering_id, holder)`. One holder's claim progress never affects another's.
    ///
    /// 6. **Auth checked first**: `holder.require_auth()` is the first operation.
    ///    All subsequent checks (blacklist, share, period count) are read-only and
    ///    produce no state changes on failure.
    ///
    /// 7. **Blacklist/whitelist decisiveness during partial sequences**: The blacklist
    ///    check is performed INSIDE the period iteration loop. If a holder becomes
    ///    blacklisted mid-sequence during a multi-period claim, the loop breaks immediately
    ///    and no subsequent periods in the batch are claimed. The index is only advanced
    ///    for periods successfully processed before the blacklist took effect. This ensures
    ///    blacklist/whitelist decisions remain decisive even during partial claim sequences.

    /// Deterministically reset the faucet state for an offering (testnet only).

    /// `faucet_reset(seed)` clears all per-requester cooldown timestamps
    /// (`FaucetLastRequest`) and all persisted seed entries (`FaucetSeedEntry`)
    /// for the given offering, then emits a single `fct_rst` event carrying the
    /// caller-supplied `seed` value so test suites can assert the exact reset.
    ///
    /// ### Security
    /// - **Strictly testnet-only.** Returns `RevoraError::TestnetOnly` when
    ///   `testnet_mode == false`.  Must never be callable on mainnet.
    /// - Requires the offering to be registered; returns `OfferingNotFound`
    ///   otherwise.
    /// - Requires admin authorisation (`admin.require_auth()`).
    ///
    /// ### Why admin-gated
    /// Clearing cooldowns is a privileged operation: an unprivileged caller
    /// could abuse it to bypass the faucet rate-limit.  Tying it to the admin
    /// key preserves the anti-spam invariant while still letting CI pipelines
    /// reset state between test runs.
    ///
    /// ### Parameters
    /// - `caller` — the admin address (must match the stored admin key).
    /// - `issuer` / `namespace` / `token` — offering identity.
    /// - `seed` — arbitrary 32-byte value chosen by the caller; carried
    ///   verbatim in the `fct_rst` event so test suites can anchor against it.
    ///
    /// ### State mutations
    /// 1. Removes `FaucetLastRequest(requester)` for every address that
    ///    previously called `faucet_seed_holders` for the given offering.
    ///    Because Soroban does not expose iteration over storage, cooldowns are
    ///    cleared by removing the well-known per-offering cooldown sentinel key
    ///    `FaucetLastRequest(offering_payer_sentinel)` and all seed entries up
    ///    to the highest index stored for the offering.
    ///
    ///    Concretely: the function removes `FaucetSeedEntry(offering_id, idx)`
    ///    for `idx` in `0..count` (where `count` is `PeriodCount`-like counter
    ///    stored in `FaucetSeedCount(offering_id)`), and resets the stored seed
    ///    count to 0 via `FaucetSeedCount`.
    ///
    /// 2. Emits `fct_rst` event.
    ///
    /// ### Returns
    /// `Ok(())` on success; `Err(RevoraError)` on any validation failure.

// Entries in the deferred distribution queue are sorted by:
//   1. `release_ts` ascending  — entries with earlier release timestamps come first.
//   2. `priority`   ascending  — lower priority value = higher urgency (0 is highest).
//   3. `queue_id`   ascending  — monotonically-increasing per-offering insertion counter;
//                                provides a strictly deterministic final tie-breaker.
//
// Auth: `issuer.require_auth()` is required for all mutations.
// Security invariant: only the current offering issuer may enqueue entries.

// ── Snapshot-Based Governance Voting (issue #557) ─────────────────────────
//
// Voting weight is pinned to the snapshot taken at the moment the proposal was
// created.  This prevents late-buy vote manipulation: any shares acquired after
// `create_gov_proposal` have zero voting weight for that proposal.
//
// Flow:
//   1. Issuer calls `create_gov_proposal` which reads the latest committed
//      snapshot_ref and stores it in `GovProposalEntry.snapshot_id`.
//   2. Any holder calls `cast_vote`.  The function looks up the voter's weight
//      via `SnapshotHolderShare(offering_id, snapshot_id, voter)` — an O(1)
//      read written by `apply_snapshot_shares` — and accumulates yes/no weight.
//   3. A `wt_pin` diagnostic event is emitted on every vote confirming the
//      snapshot_id and the resolved weight.
//   4. `get_gov_proposal` is a read-only query for off-chain indexers.
